    <h2 class="secondaryheading center">What I'm Up To</h2>
    <p class="center">I'm a very artistically inclined person- I like to write stories, draw, paint, 3d model and print objects, and I'm currently working on developing a video game.
        The game follows two girls who need to leave the desert they call home to find better thigns, 
        but cannot without some form of airship to fly past the wall keeping them safe from monsters. 
        You fight and befriend robots who populate the desert. It's what I've been spending a lot of my time on lately. 
        <br> <br>I've also been working on a larger project that I also hope to turn into a video game after I get enough 
        practice and get my name out there. I recently participated in 
        <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo</a>, 
        a challenge where you write 50,000 words in a month. I completed that challenge.</br><br>I'm majoring in Computer Science, 
        but I find it hard to find the classes interesting when my heart is more art-aligned. Don't get me wrong, I love coding, 
        but I love coding for things I'm passionate about. A cushy computer science job is my backup plan, but not the end goal. 
        Rest assured, though- that doesn't mean I won't give this class my all! </p>
